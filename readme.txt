This is the Java code for a simple Image Browsing & Editing application designed for the Object-Oriented Development in Java module coursework in my MSc Computing course.

This code was written and submitted long before I learned the importance of commenting code properly.

Toolbar button icons are not included due to licensing.


Troubleshooting:
If the application loads and the Tree is not visible, close the application, copy and paste the ‘TreeModelData’ from the ‘TreeModelBackup’ folder into the main user directory (replacing the TreeModelData file already in there), and try opening the application again.
